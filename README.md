Spring boot REST service that models the structure of a university and provides a class schedule for a specific student on a specific day. A timetable is a list of lectures that a student has on a particular day. Time and sequence are ignored.
The result of the work is a Maven project that can be compiled into one or more JAR libraries.
Used classic REST architecture.
The API provides CRUD functionality for all objects in the application (students, groups, classrooms, etc.) and an endpoint for getting the timetable.
Services are covered by unit tests.
PostgreSQL was used as the database.
Test data is generated by SQL script.
The application is packaged in docker containers and launched with a single docker-compose up -d command.

Endpoint: getting a list of lectures for a specific student - GET request “api/v1/users/{id}/lectures?day=[week day]”, where {id} – student’s id, [week day] - string with name of week day from Monday to Saturday.
Example: “api/v1/users/2/lectures?day=tuesday”.
UML diagram is in the root of the project.
